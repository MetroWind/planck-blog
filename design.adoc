= Nsblog Design

== Introduction

The goal is to provide a simple blog framework that covers the
fundamental requirement of a single-blog website; i.e. Only one blog
is hosted per server instance. The blog might be used by multiple (but
a small number of) writers. The service should be easy to deploy
without a lot of dependencies.

== Features

=== Back-end

- Supports markdown & asciidoc
- All user data, including blog posts, is stored in a single SQLite db
  file.
- Save rendered HTML (just the post body) to a cache dir at first
  visit. The cache persists until the post is modified or deleted.
- When rendering a post, go through template substitution twice. The
  1st time on the rendered post body to substitute any macros in the
  post. The 2nd time to generate the complete HTML.
- DB schema is versioned. Updates on the schema would migrate userâ€™s
  db automatically.
- Have a command line option to migrate old blog posts into the
  system.
- Will not have a table for users. All user info are from
  OpenID.

=== Front-end

- Provide real time client-side preview when writing markdown, but not adoc.
- Allow user to write arbitrary template vars in the config.

== Posts

A post contains the following fields:

ID:: Required. A unique name of the post. This is used as filename of
the post cache.
Title:: Required
Abstraction:: Required. Displayed at the posts list
Publish time:: Optional. If this is empty, the post is a draft
Update time:: Optional
Markup:: Required. Markdown or AsciiDoc
Language:: Required. This will be the value of the `lang` attribute of
the post block in HTML.
Author:: Required. The unique username of the author.
Body:: Required. The content of the post

== Object IDs

Every post and attachment has a unique ID. The post ID is just an
integer assigned by the database. The only requirement is it should
be really unique in the sense that no two posts would have the same
ID, _even if one of them (or both) has been deleted_.

The ID of an attachment is the hash of its content, as a string, in
hex representation (lower case).

== Creating a new post

== Rendering a post

=== Caching

An in-memory cache should be maintained for the rendered HTML of each
post. The rendered HTML is generated on-demand, i.e. if a post does
not have a cached version, it is generated only when visited. The
cache should just be a map from the post ID to the rendered HTML.

== Themes
